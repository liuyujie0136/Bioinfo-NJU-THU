{The figure}] She said the nomination should not be decided by
delegates from Florida and Michigan allocated on the basis of
voting in primaries there last month, as the Clinton campaign has
proposed. Mrs. Clinton got more votes in both places, although
neither candidate actively campaigned there and Mr. Obama was not
even on the ballot in Michigan. The party had penalized those
states for holding their primaries earlier than the party wanted
by stripping them of their delegates to the convention.Although
Mr. Gore has expressed concerns to some associates about the
damage a brokered convention could cause, several associates said
he was hopeful that one candidate would soon break through,
sparing the party such an outcome. He told a close friend recently
that his decision not to endorse “feels like the right thing”
and that he remained optimistic the race “is going to tip at some
point,” the friend said.
